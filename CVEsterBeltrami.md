<h2>Experience</h2>

<h3>Digitalis - Dec 2019 - Today</h3>
<h6><i>Full Stack Web Developer in <b>London</b></h6>

At Digitalis I used to work on a web application that allows the extraction of information from the web, get notified if anything chances on social media such as Twitter/Facebook and more, allowing our internal teams to work more effectively.

My primary role was to work on the **microservices**-based backend built using **Django** and **DRF** by either building new services or improving existing ones. I also took some of the **DevOps** responsibility of the project by implementing a **CI** infrastructure using **Jenkins** to test and deploy our services to **AWS** on **ElasticBeanstalk**. Occasionaly, I also helped with the **React** frontend building new features or bug fixing.


<h3>OT Consulting - May 2016 - Nov 2019</h3>
<h6><i>Full Stack Web Developer in <b>Reggio Emilia, Italy</b></i></h6>

At OT Consulting I used to be a consultant for Max Mara, an international fashion company, helping them develop and mantain their ERP web applications for inventory management, support the new Italian's electronic invoice and more. 

My responsibilities consisted of building new systems that are the correct technical solution for their needs, maintain and offer support for their existing ones and offer training to the new junior developers on Python and other technologies.
The tech stack we used for our tools was **Python** for backend and **Javascript** with **AngularJS** for the frontend.


<h2>Open source</h2>
I am working on the new website for our conference **PyCon Italy** ([https://pycon.it/](https://pycon.it/)) by helping to build it from scratch both the new backend and frontend using technologies such as **Django**, **GraphQL** and **NextJS**.

I also try to give back to the open-source community by contributing and helping projects I use and love, such as **Poetry** and more.
